Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

For that simple use-case, you can check out [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), our batteries-included approach to deploying static sites on Cloudflare's edge network. Workers Sites was designed as a precursor to Cloudflare Pages, so check out Pages if you just want to deploy your static site without any special customizations!\n\nFor users who _do_ want to customize their assets, and want to build complex experiences on top of their static assets, `kv-asset-handler` (and the default [Workers Sites template](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template), which is provided for use with Wrangler + Workers Sites) allows you to customize caching behavior, headers, and anything else about how your Workers function loads the static assets for your site stored in Workers KV.\n\nThe Cloudflare Workers Discord server is an active place where Workers users get help, share feedback, and collaborate on making our platform better. The `#workers` channel in particular is a great place to chat about `kv-asset-handler`, and building cool experiences for your users using these tools! If you have questions, want to share what you're working on, or give feedback, [join us in Discord and say hello](https://discord.cloudflare.com)!\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [`getAssetFromKV`](#getassetfromkv)\n  - [Example](#example)\n  * [Return](#return)\n  * [Optional Arguments](#optional-arguments)\n    - [`mapRequestToAsset`](#maprequesttoasset)\n    - [Example](#example-1)\n    - [`cacheControl`](#cachecontrol)\n      - [`browserTTL`](#browserttl)\n      - [`edgeTTL`](#edgettl)\n      - [`bypassCache`](#bypasscache)\n    - [`ASSET_NAMESPACE` (required for ES Modules)](#asset_namespace-required-for-es-modules)\n    - [`ASSET_MANIFEST` (required for ES Modules)](#asset_manifest-required-for-es-modules)\n    - [`defaultETag`](#defaultetag-optional)\n\n* [Helper functions](#helper-functions)\n  - [`mapRequestToAsset`](#maprequesttoasset-1)\n  - [`serveSinglePageApp`](#servesinglepageapp)\n* [Cache revalidation and etags](#cache-revalidation-and-etags)\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this package to your `package.json` by running this in the root of your\nproject's directory:\n\n```\nnpm i @cloudflare/kv-asset-handler\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis package was designed to work with [Worker Sites](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites).\n\n## `getAssetFromKV`\n\ngetAssetFromKV(Evt) => Promise<Response>\n\n`getAssetFromKV` is an async function that takes an `Evt` object (containing a `Request` and a [`waitUntil`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event#waituntil)) and returns a `Response` object if the request matches an asset in KV, otherwise it will throw a `KVError`.\n\n#### Example\n\nThis example checks for the existence of a value in KV, and returns it if it's there, and returns a 404 if it is not. It also serves index.html from `/`.\n\n### Return\n\n`getAssetFromKV` returns a `Promise<Response>` with `Response` being the body of the asset requested.\n\nKnown errors to be thrown are:\n\n- MethodNotAllowedError\n- NotFoundError\n- InternalError\n\n#### ES Modules\n\n```js\nimport manifestJSON from \"__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST\";\nimport {\n\tgetAssetFromKV,\n\tMethodNotAllowedError,\n\tNotFoundError,\n} from \"@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler\";\n\nconst assetManifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON);\n\nexport default {\n\tasync fetch(request, env, ctx) {\n\t\tif (request.url.includes(\"/docs\")) {\n\t\t\ttry {\n\t\t\t\treturn await getAssetFromKV(\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequest,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaitUntil(promise) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn ctx.waitUntil(promise);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest,\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t} catch (e) {\n\t\t\t\tif (e instanceof NotFoundError) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t\t} else if (e instanceof MethodNotAllowedError) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn new Response(\"An unexpected error occurred\", { status: 500 });\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} else return fetch(request);\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n#### Service Worker\n\n```js\nimport {\n\tgetAssetFromKV,\n\tMethodNotAllowedError,\n\tNotFoundError,\n} from \"@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler\";\n\naddEventListener(\"fetch\", (event) => {\n\tevent.respondWith(handleEvent(event));\n});\n\nasync function handleEvent(event) {\n\tif (event.request.url.includes(\"/docs\")) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\treturn await getAssetFromKV(event);\n\t\t} catch (e) {\n\t\t\tif (e instanceof NotFoundError) {\n\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t} else if (e instanceof MethodNotAllowedError) {\n\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\treturn new Response(\"An unexpected error occurred\", { status: 500 });\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t} else return fetch(event.request);\n}\n```\n\n### Optional Arguments\n\nYou can customize the behavior of `getAssetFromKV` by passing the following properties as an object into the second argument.\n\n```\ngetAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: ... })\n```\n\n#### `mapRequestToAsset`\n\nmapRequestToAsset(Request) => Request\n\nMaps the incoming request to the value that will be looked up in Cloudflare's KV\n\nBy default, mapRequestToAsset is set to the exported function [`mapRequestToAsset`](#maprequesttoasset-1). This works for most static site generators, but you can customize this behavior by passing your own function as `mapRequestToAsset`. The function should take a `Request` object as its only argument, and return a new `Request` object with an updated path to be looked up in the asset manifest/KV.\n\nFor SPA mapping pass in the [`serveSinglePageApp`](#servesinglepageapp) function\n\n#### Example\n\nStrip `/docs` from any incoming request before looking up an asset in Cloudflare's KV.\n\n```js\nimport { getAssetFromKV, mapRequestToAsset } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'\n...\nconst customKeyModifier = request => {\n  let url = request.url\n  //custom key mapping optional\n  url = url.replace('/docs', '').replace(/^\\/+/, '')\n  return mapRequestToAsset(new Request(url, request))\n}\nlet asset = await getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: customKeyModifier })\n```\n\n#### `cacheControl`\n\ntype: object\n\n`cacheControl` allows you to configure options for both the Cloudflare Cache accessed by your Worker, and the browser cache headers sent along with your Workers' responses. The default values are as follows:\n\n```javascript\nlet cacheControl = {\n\tbrowserTTL: null, // do not set cache control ttl on responses\n\tedgeTTL: 2 * 60 * 60 * 24, // 2 days\n\tbypassCache: false, // do not bypass Cloudflare's cache\n};\n```\n\n##### `browserTTL`\n\ntype: number | null\nnullable: true\n\nSets the `Cache-Control: max-age` header on the response returned from the Worker. By default set to `null` which will not add the header at all.\n\n##### `edgeTTL`\n\ntype: number | null\nnullable: true\n\nSets the `Cache-Control: max-age` header on the response used as the edge cache key. By default set to 2 days (`2 * 60 * 60 * 24`). When null will not cache on the edge at all.\n\n##### `bypassCache`\n\ntype: boolean\n\nDetermines whether to cache requests on Cloudflare's edge cache. By default set to `false` (recommended for production builds). Useful for development when you need to eliminate the cache's effect on testing.\n\n#### `ASSET_NAMESPACE` (required for ES Modules)\n\ntype: KV Namespace Binding\n\nThe binding name to the KV Namespace populated with key/value entries of files for the Worker to serve. By default, Workers Sites uses a [binding to a Workers KV Namespace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/storage/api/#namespaces) named `__STATIC_CONTENT`.\n\nIt is further assumed that this namespace consists of static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or image files, keyed off of a relative path that roughly matches the assumed URL pathname of the incoming request.\n\nIn ES Modules format, this argument is required, and can be gotten from `env`.\n\n##### ES Module\n\n```js\nreturn getAssetFromKV(\n\t{\n\t\trequest,\n\t\twaitUntil(promise) {\n\t\t\treturn ctx.waitUntil(promise)\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,\n\t},\n)\n```\n\n##### Service Worker\n\n```\nreturn getAssetFromKV(event, { ASSET_NAMESPACE: MY_NAMESPACE })\n```\n\n#### `ASSET_MANIFEST` (required for ES Modules)\n\ntype: text blob (JSON formatted) or object\n\nThe mapping of requested file path to the key stored on Cloudflare.\n\nWorkers Sites with Wrangler bundles up a text blob that maps request paths to content-hashed keys that are generated by Wrangler as a cache-busting measure. If this option/binding is not present, the function will fallback to using the raw pathname to look up your asset in KV. If, for whatever reason, you have rolled your own implementation of this, you can include your own by passing a stringified JSON object where the keys are expected paths, and the values are the expected keys in your KV namespace.\n\nIn ES Modules format, this argument is required, and can be imported.\n\n##### ES Module\n\n```js\nimport manifestJSON from '__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST'\nlet manifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON)\nmanifest['index.html'] = 'index.special.html'\n\nreturn getAssetFromKV(\n\t{\n\t\trequest,\n\t\twaitUntil(promise) {\n\t\t\treturn ctx.waitUntil(promise)\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tASSET_MANIFEST: manifest,\n\t\t// ...\n\t},\n)\n```\n\n##### Service Worker\n\n```\nlet assetManifest = { \"index.html\": \"index.special.html\" }\nreturn getAssetFromKV(event, { ASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest })\n```\n\n#### `defaultMimeType` (optional)\n\ntype: string\n\nThis is the mime type that will be used for files with unrecognized or missing extensions. The default value is `'text/plain'`.\n\nIf you are serving a static site and would like to use extensionless HTML files instead of index.html files, set this to `'text/html'`.\n\n#### `defaultDocument` (optional)\n\ntype: string\n\nThis is the default document that will be concatenated for requests ends in `'/'` or without a valid mime type like `'/about'` or `'/about.me'`. The default value is `'index.html'`.\n\n#### `defaultETag` (optional)\n\ntype: `'strong' | 'weak'`\n\nThis determines the format of the response [ETag header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag). If the resource is in the cache, the ETag will always be weakened before being returned.\nThe default value is `'strong'`.\n\n# Helper functions\n\n## `mapRequestToAsset`\n\nmapRequestToAsset(Request) => Request\n\nThe default function for mapping incoming requests to keys in Cloudflare's KV.\n\nTakes any path that ends in `/` or evaluates to an HTML file and appends `index.html` or `/index.html` for lookup in your Workers KV namespace.\n\n## `serveSinglePageApp`\n\nserveSinglePageApp(Request) => Request\n\nA custom handler for mapping requests to a single root: `index.html`. The most common use case is single-page applications - frameworks with in-app routing - such as React Router, VueJS, etc. It takes zero arguments.\n\n```js\nimport { getAssetFromKV, serveSinglePageApp } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'\n...\nlet asset = await getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: serveSinglePageApp })\n```\n\n# Cache revalidation and etags\n\nAll responses served from cache (including those with `cf-cache-status: MISS`) include an `etag` response header that identifies the version of the resource. The `etag` value is identical to the path key used in the `ASSET_MANIFEST`. It is updated each time an asset changes and looks like this: `etag: <filename>.<hash of file contents>.<extension>` (ex. `etag: index.54321.html`).\n\nResources served with an `etag` allow browsers to use the `if-none-match` request header to make conditional requests for that resource in the future. This has two major benefits:\n\n- When a request's `if-none-match` value matches the `etag` of the resource in Cloudflare cache, Cloudflare will send a `304 Not Modified` response without a body, saving bandwidth.\n- Changes to a file on the server are immediately reflected in the browser - even when the cache control directive `max-age` is unexpired.\n\n#### Disable the `etag`\n\nTo turn `etags` **off**, you must bypass cache:\n\n```js\n/* Turn etags off */\nlet cacheControl = {\n\tbypassCache: true,\n};\n```\n\n#### Syntax and comparison context\n\n`kv-asset-handler` sets and evaluates etags as [strong validators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests#Strong_validation). To preserve `etag` integrity, the format of the value deviates from the [RFC2616 recommendation to enclose the `etag` with quotation marks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.11). This is intentional. Cloudflare cache applies the `W/` prefix to all `etags` that use quoted-strings -- a process that converts the `etag` to a \"weak validator\" when served to a client."},"@esbuild/win32-x64":{"licenses":"MIT","copyright":"","licenseText":"# esbuild\n\nThis is the Windows 64-bit binary for esbuild, a JavaScript bundler and minifier.

Used by [Parcel 2](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).\n\n## Features\n\n- **Watch** - subscribe to realtime recursive directory change notifications when files or directories are created, updated, or deleted.\n- **Query** - performantly query for historical change events in a directory, even when your program is not running.\n- **Native** - implemented in C++ for performance and low-level integration with the operating system.\n- **Cross platform** - includes backends for macOS, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, and Watchman.\n- **Performant** - events are throttled in C++ so the JavaScript thread is not overwhelmed during large filesystem changes (e.g. `git checkout` or `npm install`).\n- **Scalable** - tens of thousands of files can be watched or queried at once with good performance.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nconst watcher = require('@parcel/watcher');\nconst path = require('path');\n\n// Subscribe to events\nlet subscription = await watcher.subscribe(process.cwd(), (err, events) => {\n  console.log(events);\n});\n\n// later on...\nawait subscription.unsubscribe();\n\n// Get events since some saved snapshot in the past\nlet snapshotPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'snapshot.txt');\nlet events = await watcher.getEventsSince(process.cwd(), snapshotPath);\n\n// Save a snapshot for later\nawait watcher.writeSnapshot(process.cwd(), snapshotPath);\n```\n\n## Watching\n\n`@parcel/watcher` supports subscribing to realtime notifications of changes in a directory. It works recursively, so changes in sub-directories will also be emitted.\n\nEvents are throttled and coalesced for performance during large changes like `git checkout` or `npm install`, and a single notification will be emitted with all of the events at the end.\n\nOnly one notification will be emitted per file. For example, if a file was both created and updated since the last event, you'll get only a `create` event. If a file is both created and deleted, you will not be notifed of that file. Renames cause two events: a `delete` for the old name, and a `create` for the new name.\n\n```javascript\nlet subscription = await watcher.subscribe(process.cwd(), (err, events) => {\n  console.log(events);\n});\n```\n\nEvents have two properties:\n\n- `type` - the event type: `create`, `update`, or `delete`.\n- `path` - the absolute path to the file or directory.\n\nTo unsubscribe from change notifications, call the `unsubscribe` method on the returned subscription object.\n\n```javascript\nawait subscription.unsubscribe();\n```\n\n`@parcel/watcher` has the following watcher backends, listed in priority order:\n\n- [FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events) on macOS\n- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) if installed\n- [inotify](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html) on Linux\n- [ReadDirectoryChangesW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365465%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) on Windows\n- [kqueue](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?kqueue) on FreeBSD, or as an alternative to FSEvents on macOS\n\nYou can specify the exact backend you wish to use by passing the `backend` option. If that backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead. See below for the list of backend names that can be passed to the options.\n\n## Querying\n\n`@parcel/watcher` also supports querying for historical changes made in a directory, even when your program is not running. This makes it easy to invalidate a cache and re-build only the files that have changed, for example. It can be **significantly** faster than traversing the entire filesystem to determine what files changed, depending on the platform.\n\nIn order to query for historical changes, you first need a previous snapshot to compare to. This can be saved to a file with the `writeSnapshot` function, e.g. just before your program exits.\n\n```javascript\nawait watcher.writeSnapshot(dirPath, snapshotPath);\n```\n\nWhen your program starts up, you can query for changes that have occurred since that snapshot using the `getEventsSince` function.\n\n```javascript\nlet events = await watcher.getEventsSince(dirPath, snapshotPath);\n```\n\nThe events returned are exactly the same as the events that would be passed to the `subscribe` callback (see above).\n\n`@parcel/watcher` has the following watcher backends, listed in priority order:\n\n- [FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events) on macOS\n- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) if installed\n- [fts](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fts.3.html) (brute force) on Linux and FreeBSD\n- [FindFirstFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstfilea) (brute force) on Windows\n\nThe FSEvents (macOS) and Watchman backends are significantly more performant than the brute force backends used by default on Linux and Windows, for example returning results in miliseconds instead of seconds for large directory trees. This is because a background daemon monitoring filesystem changes on those platforms allows us to query cached data rather than traversing the filesystem manually (brute force).\n\nmacOS has good performance with FSEvents by default. For the best performance on other platforms, install [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) and it will be used by `@parcel/watcher` automatically.\n\nYou can specify the exact backend you wish to use by passing the `backend` option. If that backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead. See below for the list of backend names that can be passed to the options.\n\n## Options\n\nAll of the APIs in `@parcel/watcher` support the following options, which are passed as an object as the last function argument.\n\n- `ignore` - an array of paths or glob patterns to ignore. uses [`is-glob`](https://github.com/micromatch/is-glob) to distinguish paths from globs. glob patterns are parsed with [`micromatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) (see [features](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features)).\n  - paths can be relative or absolute and can either be files or directories. No events will be emitted about these files or directories or their children.\n  - glob patterns match on relative paths from the root that is watched. No events will be emitted for matching paths.\n- `backend` - the name of an explicitly chosen backend to use. Allowed options are `\"fs-events\"`, `\"watchman\"`, `\"inotify\"`, `\"kqueue\"`, `\"windows\"`, or `\"brute-force\"` (only for querying). If the specified backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead.\n\n## WASM\n\nThe `@parcel/watcher-wasm` package can be used in place of `@parcel/watcher` on unsupported platforms. It relies on the Node `fs` module, so in non-Node environments such as browsers, an `fs` polyfill will be needed.\n\n**Note**: the WASM implementation is significantly less efficient than the native implementations because it must crawl the file system to watch each directory individually. Use the native `@parcel/watcher` package wherever possible.\n\n```js\nimport {subscribe} from '@parcel/watcher-wasm';\n\n// Use the module as documented above.\nsubscribe(/* ... */);\n```\n\n## Who is using this?\n\n- [Parcel 2](https://parceljs.org/)\n- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_62#_file-watching-changes)\n- [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense)\n- [Gatsby Cloud](https://twitter.com/chatsidhartha/status/1435647412828196867)\n- [Nx](https://nx.dev)\n- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)\n\n## License\n\nMIT"},"@parcel/watcher-win32-x64":{"licenses":"MIT","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2017-present Devon Govett","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017-present Devon Govett\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g.

Exceptions and Limitations.

Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so.

For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Default depends on method, e.g. `_` in snake case.\n- `locale?: string[] | string | false` Lower/upper according to specified locale, defaults to host environment. Set to `false` to disable.\n- `split?: (value: string) => string[]` A function to define how the input is split into words. Defaults to `split`.\n- `prefixCharacters?: string` Retain at the beginning of the string. Defaults to `\"\"`. Example: use `\"_\"` to keep the underscores in `__typename`.\n- `suffixCharacters?: string` Retain at the end of the string. Defaults to `\"\"`. Example: use `\"_\"` to keep the underscore in `type_`.\n\nBy default, `pascalCase` and `snakeCase` separate ambiguous characters with `_`. For example, `V1.2` would become `V1_2` instead of `V12`. If you prefer them merged you can set `mergeAmbiguousCharacters` to `true`.\n\n### Split\n\n**Change case** exports a `split` utility which can be used to build other case functions. It accepts a string and returns each \"word\" as an array. For example:\n\n```js\nsplit(\"fooBar\")\n  .map((x) => x.toLowerCase())\n  .join(\"_\"); //=> \"foo_bar\"\n```\n\n## Change Case Keys\n\n```js\nimport * as changeKeys from \"change-case/keys\";\n\nchangeKeys.camelCase({ TEST_KEY: true }); //=> { testKey: true }\n```\n\n**Change case keys** wraps around the core methods to transform object keys to any case.\n\n### API\n\n- **input: any** Any JavaScript value.\n- **depth: number** Specify the depth to transfer for case transformation. Defaults to `1`.\n- **options: object** Same as base case library.\n\n## TypeScript and ESM\n\nThis package is a [pure ESM package](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) and ships with TypeScript definitions. It cannot be `require`'d or used with CommonJS module resolution in TypeScript.\n\n## License\n\nMIT"},"chokidar":{"licenses":"MIT","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com), Elan Shanker","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com), Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Build high-performance animations that work in **every** major browser. Animate CSS, SVG, canvas, React, Vue, WebGL, colors, strings, motion paths, generic objects...anything JavaScript can touch! GSAP's <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/\">ScrollTrigger</a> plugin delivers jaw-dropping scroll-based animations with minimal code. <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.matchMedia()\">gsap.matchMedia()</a> makes building responsive, accessibility-friendly animations a breeze.\n\nNo other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, and tight control while solving real-world problems on over 12 million sites. GSAP works around countless browser inconsistencies; your animations ***just work***. At its core, GSAP is a high-speed property manipulator, updating values over time with extreme accuracy. It's up to 20x faster than jQuery!\n\nGSAP is completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want. **Zero dependencies.**\n\nThere are many optional <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins\">plugins</a> and <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases\">easing</a> functions for achieving advanced effects easily like <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/\">scrolling</a>, <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin\">morphing</a>, animating along a <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MotionPathPlugin\">motion path</a> or <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Flip/\">FLIP</a> animations. There's even a handy <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/\">Observer</a> for normalizing event detection across browsers/devices. \n\n\n### Get Started\n\n[![Get Started with GSAP](http://gsap.com/_img/github/get-started.jpg)](http://gsap.com/get-started)\n\n\n## Docs &amp; Installation\n\nView the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs\">full documentation here</a>, including an <a href=\"https://gsap.com/install\">installation guide</a>.\n\n### CDN\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.12/dist/gsap.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nSee <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/gsap\">JSDelivr's dedicated GSAP page</a> for quick CDN links to the core files/plugins. There are more <a href=\"https://gsap.com/install\">installation instructions</a> at gsap.com.\n\n**Every major ad network excludes GSAP from file size calculations** and most have it on their own CDNs, so contact them for the appropriate URL(s). \n\n### NPM\nSee the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/install\">guide to using GSAP via NPM here</a>.\n\n```javascript\nnpm install gsap\n```\n\nGSAP's core can animate almost anything including CSS and attributes, plus it includes all of the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods\">utility methods</a> like <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods/interpolate()\">interpolate()</a>, <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods/mapRange()\">mapRange()</a>, most of the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases\">eases</a>, and it can do snapping and modifiers. \n\n```javascript\n// typical import\nimport gsap from \"gsap\";\n\n// get other plugins:\nimport ScrollTrigger from \"gsap/ScrollTrigger\";\nimport Flip from \"gsap/Flip\";\nimport Draggable from \"gsap/Draggable\";\n\n// or all tools are exported from the \"all\" file (excluding members-only plugins):\nimport { gsap, ScrollTrigger, Draggable, MotionPathPlugin } from \"gsap/all\";\n\n// don't forget to register plugins\ngsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, Draggable, Flip, MotionPathPlugin); \n```\n\nThe NPM files are ES modules, but there's also a /dist/ directory with <a href=\"https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/\">UMD</a> files for extra compatibility.\n\nDownload <a href=\"https://gsap.com/pricing/\">Club GSAP</a> members-only plugins from your gsap.com account and then include them in your own JS payload. There's even a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znVi89_gazE\">tarball file you can install with NPM/Yarn</a>. GSAP has a <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation#private\">private NPM registry</a> for members too. Post questions in our <a href=\"https://gsap.com/community/\">forums</a> and we'd be happy to help.\n\n### ScrollTrigger &amp; ScrollSmoother\n\nIf you're looking for scroll-driven animations, GSAP's <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/\">ScrollTrigger</a> plugin is the new standard. There's a companion <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollSmoother/\">ScrollSmoother</a> as well.\n\n[![ScrollTrigger](http://gsap.com/_img/github/scrolltrigger.jpg)](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger)\n\n### Using React? \n\nThere's a <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gsap/react\">@gsap/react</a> package that exposes a `useGSAP()` hook which is a drop-in replacement for `useEffect()`/`useLayoutEffect()`, automating cleanup tasks. Please read the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/react\">React guide</a> for details.\n\n### Resources\n\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/\">gsap.com</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/get-started/\">Getting started guide</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/\">Docs</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/resources/demos\">Demos &amp; starter templates</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/community/\">Community forums</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases\">Ease Visualizer</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/showcase\">Showcase</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@GreenSockLearning\">YouTube Channel</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/cheatsheet\">Cheat sheet</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/trial\">Try bonus plugins for free</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/pricing/\">Club GSAP</a> (get access to unrestricted bonus plugins that are not in this repository)\n\n### What is Club GSAP?\n\nThere are 3 main reasons anyone signs up for <a href=\"https://gsap.com/pricing\">Club GSAP</a>: \n* To get access to snazzy <a href=\"https://gsap.com/pricing\">members-only plugins</a> like MorphSVG, SplitText, ScrollSmoother, etc.\n* To get the special <a href=\"https://gsap.com/licensing/\">commercial license</a>.\n* To support ongoing development efforts and **cheer us on**.\n\n<a href=\"https://gsap.com/pricing/\">Learn more</a>.\n\n### Try all bonus plugins for free!\n<a href=\"https://gsap.com/trial\">https://gsap.com/trial</a>\n\n### Need help?\nAsk in the friendly <a href=\"https://gsap.com/community/\">GSAP forums</a>.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c.

Enables using some native Node modules in browsers and other environments.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo use napi-wasm, there are a few requirements:\n\n1. Configure your linker to export an indirect function table. With ldd, this is the `--export-table` flag. This enables JavaScript to call callback functions registered by WASM. It is exposed in the WebAssembly exports as `__indirect_function_table`.\n2. Export a function from your WASM build named `napi_register_module_v1` (Node's default), or `napi_register_wasm_v1` for WASM-specific builds. This is called during initialization to setup the `exports` object for your module. It receives an environment and an exports object pointer as arguments, which you can add properties to.\n3. Include a function named `napi_wasm_malloc` in your WASM build. This is called from JavaScript by napi-wasm to allocate memory in the WASM heap. It should accept a `uint32` size argument indicating the number of bytes to allocate, and return a `uint8` pointer to allocated memory.\n4. Compile for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.\n\n### In Rust\n\nThe above steps should apply for any programming language, but here's an example in Rust. First, define a `napi_wasm_malloc` function so JavaScript can allocate memory in the WASM heap using the default allocator.\n\n```rust\nuse std::alloc::{alloc, Layout};\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn napi_wasm_malloc(size: usize) -> *mut u8 {\n  let align = std::mem::align_of::<usize>();\n  if let Ok(layout) = Layout::from_size_align(size, align) {\n    unsafe {\n      if layout.size() > 0 {\n        let ptr = alloc(layout);\n        if !ptr.is_null() {\n          return ptr;\n        }\n      } else {\n        return align as *mut u8;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  std::process::abort();\n}\n```\n\nNext, implement `napi_register_wasm_v1` to register your module exports. We'll use the [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) bindings in this example to make it a bit nicer than calling C APIs directly. Note that the napi-rs `#[module_exports]` macro currently doesn't work in WASM because Rust doesn't support ctor setup functions in WASM targets yet, so we'll need to do this manually.\n\n```rust\nuse napi::{Env, JsObject, NapiValue};\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub unsafe extern \"C\" fn napi_register_wasm_v1(raw_env: napi::sys::napi_env, raw_exports: napi::sys::napi_value) {\n  let env = Env::from_raw(raw_env);\n  let exports = JsObject::from_raw_unchecked(raw_env, raw_exports);\n\n  exports.create_named_method(\"transform\", transform);\n}\n\n#[js_function(1)]\nfn transform(ctx: CallContext) -> napi::Result<JsUnknown> {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nTo compile, you need to export a function table and use the correct target.\n\n```shell\n RUSTFLAGS=\"-C link-arg=--export-table\" cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown\n```\n\nThis will output a file in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/YOUR_CRATE.wasm` which you can load in a JavaScript environment.\n\nYou can also put the rust flags in a `.cargo/config.toml` file so you don't need to provide the environment variable each time you run `cargo build`.\n\n```toml\n[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]\nrustflags = [\"-C\", \"link-arg=--export-table\"]\n```\n\n### Loading\n\nTo load a WASM file and initialize a napi environment, you'll need to import the `napi-wasm` package. You instantiate a WASM module as usual, providing `napi` as the `env` import key. This provides the napi functions for your WASM module to use.\n\nThen, pass the WASM instance to the `Environment` constructor to setup a napi environment. This will call `napi_register_wasm_v1` or `napi_register_module_v1` to setup the exports object. Then you can call functions on the exports object as you would in Node.\n\n```js\nimport { Environment, napi } from 'napi-wasm';\n\n// Construct a URL and instantiate a WebAssembly module as usual.\nconst url = new URL('path/to/lib.wasm', import.meta.url);\nconst { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(url), {\n  env: napi\n});\n\n// Create an environment.\nlet env = new Environment(instance);\nlet exports = env.exports;\n\n// Use exports as usual!\nexports.transform({\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nWhen you are done with an `Environment`, call the `destroy()` function to clean up memory."},"nitropack":{"licenses":"MIT","copyright":"Copyright (c) Pooya Parsa <pooya@pi0.io> and Nitro contributors","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Pooya Parsa <pooya@pi0.io> and Nitro contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."},"node-gyp-build":{"licenses":"MIT","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2017 Mathias Buus","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Mathias Buus\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If you want a fun TypeScript challenge\nthen please open a PR :).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev packrup\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn add --dev packrup\n```\n\n## API\n\n### packArray\n\n**Arguments**\n\n- _input_ - `array`\n\n  The array to pack\n\n- _options_ -  `{ key: string | string[], value: string | string[] }`\n\n  The options to use to resolve the key and value.\n  By default, will choose first 2 keys of an object.\n\n```ts\nimport { packArray } from 'packrup'\n\npackArray([\n  { 'http-equiv': 'content-security-policy', 'content': 'content-src none' }\n])\n\n// {\n//    'content-security-policy': 'content-src none',\n// }\n```\n\n### packObject\n\n**Arguments**\n\n- _input_ - `object`\n\n  The record to pack.\n\n- _options_ -  `{ key: string | string[], value: string | string[] }`\n\n  The options to use to resolve the key and value.\n  By default, will choose first 2 keys of an object.\n\n```ts\nimport { packObject } from 'packrup'\n\npackObject({\n  image: {\n    src: {\n      '1x': 'https://example.com/image.png',\n      '2x': 'https://example.com/image@2x.png'\n    },\n    alt: 'Example Image'\n  },\n}, {\n  key: 'image.src.1x',\n  value: 'image.alt'\n})\n\n// {\n//   \"https://example.com/image.png\": \"Example Image\",\n// }\n```\n\n### packString\n\n```ts\nimport { packString } from 'packrup'\n\nconst head = packString('src=\"https://example.com/image.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"')\n// {\n//   \"height\": \"600\",\n//   \"src\": \"https://example.com/image.jpg\",\n//   \"width\": \"800\",\n// }\n```\n\n### unpackToArray\n\n**Arguments**\n\n- _input_ - `array`\n\n  The array to pack\n\n- _options_ -  `{ key: string | string[], value: string | string[] }`\n\n  The options to use to resolve the key and value.\n  By default, will choose first 2 keys of an object.\n\n```ts\nimport { unpackToArray } from 'packrup'\n\nunpackToArray({\n  'content-security-policy': 'content-src none',\n}, { key: 'http-equiv', value: 'content' })\n```\n\n### unpackToString\n\n**Arguments**\n\n- _input_ - `object`\n\n  The record to unpack to a string.\n\n- _options_\n\n```ts\nexport interface TransformValueOptions {\n  entrySeparator?: string\n  keyValueSeparator?: string\n  wrapValue?: string\n  resolve?: (ctx: { key: string, value: unknown }) => string | void\n}\n```\n\n```ts\nimport { unpackToString } from 'packrup'\n\nunpackToString({\n  'noindex': true,\n  'nofollow': true,\n  'max-snippet': 20,\n  'maxi-image-preview': 'large',\n}, {\n  resolve({ key, value }) {\n    if (typeof value === 'boolean')\n      return `${key}`\n  },\n  keyValueSeparator: ':',\n  entrySeparator: ', ',\n})\n\n// \"noindex, nofollow, max-snippet:20, maxi-image-preview:large\"\n```\n\n## Sponsors\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harlan-zw/static/main/sponsors.svg\">\n    <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harlan-zw/static/main/sponsors.svg'/>\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n## License\n\nMIT License © 2022-PRESENT [Harlan Wilton](https://github.com/harlan-zw)"},"parse-git-config":{"licenses":"MIT","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2015-present, Jon Schlinkert.","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-present, Jon Schlinkert.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

for advanced users and use cases.\n\n## Using Task Promises\n\nEach task in the API returns the `simpleGit` instance for chaining together multiple tasks, and each\nstep in the chain is also a `Promise` that can be `await` ed in an `async` function or returned in a\n`Promise` chain.\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\n\n// chain together tasks to await final result\nawait git.init().addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');\n\n// or await each step individually\nawait git.init();\nawait git.addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');\n```\n\n### Catching errors in async code\n\nTo catch errors in async code, either wrap the whole chain in a try/catch:\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\ntry {\n   await git.init();\n   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);\n} catch (e) {\n   /* handle all errors here */\n}\n```\n\nor catch individual steps to permit the main chain to carry on executing rather than\njumping to the final `catch` on the first error:\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\ntry {\n   await git.init().catch(ignoreError);\n   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);\n} catch (e) {\n   /* handle all errors here */\n}\n\nfunction ignoreError() {}\n```\n\n## Using Task Callbacks\n\nIn addition to returning a promise, each method can also be called with a trailing callback argument\nto handle the result of the task.\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\ngit.init(onInit).addRemote('origin', 'git@github.com:steveukx/git-js.git', onRemoteAdd);\n\nfunction onInit(err, initResult) {}\nfunction onRemoteAdd(err, addRemoteResult) {}\n```\n\nIf any of the steps in the chain result in an error, all pending steps will be cancelled, see the\n[parallel tasks](<(#concurrent--parallel-requests)>) section for more information on how to run tasks in parallel rather than in series .\n\n## Task Responses\n\nWhether using a trailing callback or a Promise, tasks either return the raw `string` or `Buffer` response from the\n`git` binary, or where possible a parsed interpretation of the response.\n\nFor type details of the response for each of the tasks, please see the [TypeScript definitions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/simple-git.d.ts).\n\n# Upgrading from Version 2\n\nFrom v3 of `simple-git` you can now import as an ES module, Common JS module or as TypeScript with bundled type\ndefinitions. Upgrading from v2 will be seamless for any application not relying on APIs that were marked as deprecated\nin v2 (deprecation notices were logged to `stdout` as `console.warn` in v2).\n\n# API\n\n|

Use the `.installed` property of the result to determine whether `git` is accessible on the path.\n\n## changing the working directory [examples](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/examples/git-change-working-directory.md)\n\n-  `.cwd(workingDirectory)` Sets the working directory for all future commands - note, this will change the working for the root instance, any chain created from the root will also be changed.\n-  `.cwd({ path, root = false })` Sets the working directory for all future commands either in the current chain of commands (where `root` is omitted or set to `false`) or in the main instance (where `root` is `true`).\n\n## How to Specify Options\n\nWhere the task accepts custom options (eg: `pull` or `commit`), these can be supplied as an object, the keys of which\nwill all be merged as trailing arguments in the command string, or as a simple array of strings.\n\n### Options as an Object\n\nWhen the value of the property in the options object is a `string`, that name value\npair will be included in the command string as `name=value`. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'\ngit.pull('origin', 'master', { '--no-rebase': null });\n\n// results in 'git pull origin master --rebase=true'\ngit.pull('origin', 'master', { '--rebase': 'true' });\n```\n\n### Options as an Array\n\nOptions can also be supplied as an array of strings to be merged into the task's commands\nin the same way as when an object is used:\n\n```javascript\n// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'\ngit.pull('origin', 'master', ['--no-rebase']);\n```\n\n# Release History\n\nMajor release 3.x changes the packaging of the library, making it consumable as a CommonJS module, ES module as well as\nwith TypeScript (see [usage](#usage) above). The library is now published as a single file, so please ensure your\napplication hasn't been making use of non-documented APIs by importing from a sub-directory path.\n\nSee also:\n\n- [release notes v3](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/CHANGELOG.md)\n- [release notes v2](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/RELEASE-NOTES-V2.md)\n\n# Concurrent / Parallel Requests\n\nWhen the methods of `simple-git` are chained together, they create an execution chain that will run in series, useful\nfor when the tasks themselves are order-dependent, eg:\n\n```typescript\nsimpleGit().init().addRemote('origin', 'https://some-repo.git').fetch();\n```\n\nEach task requires that the one before it has been run successfully before it is called, any errors in a\nstep of the chain should prevent later steps from being attempted.\n\nWhen the methods of `simple-git` are called on the root instance (ie: `git = simpleGit()`) rather than chained\noff another task, it starts a new chain and will not be affected failures in tasks already being run. Useful\nfor when the tasks are independent of each other, eg:\n\n```typescript\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconst results = await Promise.all([\n   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-cdup').catch(swallow),\n   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-prefix').catch(swallow),\n]);\nfunction swallow(err) {\n   return null;\n}\n```\n\nEach `simple-git` instance limits the number of spawned child processes that can be run simultaneously and\nmanages the queue of pending tasks for you. Configure this value by passing an options object to the\n`simpleGit` function, eg:\n\n```typescript\nconst git = simpleGit({ maxConcurrentProcesses: 10 });\n```\n\nTreating tasks called on the root instance as the start of separate chains is a change to the behaviour of\n`simple-git` and was added in version `2.11.0`.\n\n# Complex Requests\n\nWhen no suitable wrapper exists in the interface for creating a request, run the command directly\nusing `git.raw([...], handler)`. The array of commands are passed directly to the `git` binary:\n\n```javascript\nconst path = '/path/to/repo';\nconst commands = ['config', '--global', 'advice.pushNonFastForward', 'false'];\n\n// using an array of commands and node-style callback\nsimpleGit(path).raw(commands, (err, result) => {\n   // err is null unless this command failed\n   // result is the raw output of this command\n});\n\n// using a var-args of strings and awaiting rather than using the callback\nconst result = await simpleGit(path).raw(...commands);\n\n// automatically trim trailing white-space in responses\nconst result = await simpleGit(path, { trimmed: true }).raw(...commands);\n```\n\n# Authentication\n\nThe easiest way to supply a username / password to the remote host is to include it in the URL, for example:\n\n```javascript\nconst USER = 'something';\nconst PASS = 'somewhere';\nconst REPO = 'github.com/username/private-repo';\n\nconst remote = `https://${USER}:${PASS}@${REPO}`;\n\nsimpleGit()\n   .clone(remote)\n   .then(() => console.log('finished'))\n   .catch((err) => console.error('failed: ', err));\n```\n\nBe sure to not enable debug logging when using this mechanism for authentication\nto ensure passwords aren't logged to stdout.\n\n# Environment Variables\n\nPass one or more environment variables to the child processes spawned by `simple-git` with the `.env` method which\nsupports passing either an object of name=value pairs or setting a single variable at a time:\n\n```javascript\nconst GIT_SSH_COMMAND = 'ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no';\n\nsimpleGit()\n   .env('GIT_SSH_COMMAND', GIT_SSH_COMMAND)\n   .status((err, status) => {\n      /*  */\n   });\n\nsimpleGit()\n   .env({ ...process.env, GIT_SSH_COMMAND })\n   .status()\n   .then((status) => {})\n   .catch((err) => {});\n```\n\nNote - when passing environment variables into the child process, these will replace the standard `process.env`\nvariables, the example above creates a new object based on `process.env` but with the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` property added.\n\n# Exception Handling\n\nWhen the `git` process exits with a non-zero status (or in some cases like `merge` the git process exits with a\nsuccessful zero code but there are conflicts in the merge) the task will reject with a `GitError` when there is no\navailable parser to handle the error or a\n`GitResponseError` for when there is.\n\nSee the `err` property of the callback:\n\n```javascript\ngit.merge((err, mergeSummary) => {\n   if (err.git) {\n      mergeSummary = err.git; // the failed mergeSummary\n   }\n});\n```\n\nCatch errors with try/catch in async code:\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n   const mergeSummary = await git.merge();\n   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);\n} catch (err) {\n   // err.message - the string summary of the error\n   // err.stack - some stack trace detail\n   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content\n\n   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${err.git.conflicts.length} conflicts`);\n}\n```\n\nCatch errors with a `.catch` on the promise:\n\n```javascript\nconst mergeSummary = await git.merge().catch((err) => {\n   if (err.git) {\n      return err.git;\n   } // the unsuccessful mergeSummary\n   throw err; // some other error, so throw\n});\n\nif (mergeSummary.failed) {\n   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${mergeSummary.conflicts.length} conflicts`);\n}\n```\n\nWith typed errors available in TypeScript\n\n```typescript\nimport { simpleGit, MergeSummary, GitResponseError } from 'simple-git';\ntry {\n   const mergeSummary = await simpleGit().merge();\n   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);\n} catch (err) {\n   // err.message - the string summary of the error\n   // err.stack - some stack trace detail\n   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content\n   const mergeSummary: MergeSummary = (err as GitResponseError<MergeSummary>).git;\n   const conflicts = mergeSummary?.conflicts || [];\n\n   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${conflicts.length} conflicts`);\n}\n```\n\n# Troubleshooting / FAQ\n\n### Enable logging\n\nSee the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md) for logging examples and how to\nmake use of the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library's programmatic interface\nin your application.\n\n### Enable Verbose Logging\n\nSee the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md#verbose-logging-options) for\nthe full list of verbose logging options to use with the\n[debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library.\n\n### Every command returns ENOENT error message\n\nThere are a few potential reasons:\n\n-  `git` isn't available as a binary for the user running the main `node` process, custom paths to the binary can be used\n   with the `.customBinary(...)` API option.\n\n-  the working directory passed in to the main `simple-git` function isn't accessible, check it is read/write accessible\n   by the user running the `node` process. This library uses\n   [@kwsites/file-exists](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kwsites/file-exists) to validate the working directory exists,\n   to output its logs add `@kwsites/file-exists` to your `DEBUG` environment variable. eg:\n\n   `DEBUG=@kwsites/file-exists,simple-git node ./your-app.js`\n\n### Log format fails\n\nThe properties of `git log` are fetched using the `--pretty=format` argument which supports different tokens depending\non the version of `git` - for example the `%D` token used to show the refs was added in git `2.2.3`, for any version\nbefore that please ensure you are supplying your own format object with properties supported by the version of git you\nare using.\n\nFor more details of the supported tokens, please see the\n[official `git log` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats)\n\n### Log response properties are out of order\n\nThe properties of `git.log` are fetched using the character sequence `ò` as a delimiter. If your commit messages\nuse this sequence, supply a custom `splitter` in the options, for example: `git.log({ splitter: '💻' })`\n\n### Pull / Diff / Merge summary responses don't recognise any files\n\n-  Enable verbose logs with the environment variable `DEBUG=simple-git:task:*,simple-git:output:*`\n-  Check the output (for example: `simple-git:output:diff:1 [stdOut] 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)`)\n-  Check the `stdOut` output is the same as you would expect to see when running the command directly in terminal\n-  Check the language used in the response is english locale\n\nIn some cases `git` will show progress messages or additional detail on error states in the output for\n`stdErr` that will help debug your issue, these messages are also included in the verbose log.\n\n### Legacy Node Versions\n\nFrom `v3.x`, `simple-git` will drop support for `node.js` version 10 or below, to use in a lower version of node will\nresult in errors such as:\n\n-  `Object.fromEntries is not a function`\n-  `Object.entries is not a function`\n-  `message.flatMap is not a function`\n\nTo resolve these issues, either upgrade to a newer version of node.js or ensure you are using the necessary polyfills\nfrom `core-js` - see [Legacy Node Versions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/LEGACY_NODE_VERSIONS.md).\n\n# Examples\n\n### using a pathspec to limit the scope of the task\n\nIf the `simple-git` API doesn't explicitly limit the scope of the task being run (ie: `git.add()` requires the files to\nbe added, but `git.status()` will run against the entire repo), add a `pathspec` to the command using trailing options:\n\n```typescript\nimport { simpleGit, pathspec } from \"simple-git\";\n\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconst wholeRepoStatus = await git.status();\nconst subDirStatusUsingOptArray = await git.status([pathspec('sub-dir')]);\nconst subDirStatusUsingOptObject = await git.status({ 'sub-dir': pathspec('sub-dir') });\n```\n\n### async await\n\n```javascript\nasync function status(workingDir) {\n   let statusSummary = null;\n   try {\n      statusSummary = await simpleGit(workingDir).status();\n   } catch (e) {\n      // handle the error\n   }\n\n   return statusSummary;\n}\n\n// using the async function\nstatus(__dirname + '/some-repo').then((status) => console.log(status));\n```\n\n### Initialise a git repo if necessary\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit(__dirname);\n\ngit.checkIsRepo()\n   .then((isRepo) => !isRepo && initialiseRepo(git))\n   .then(() => git.fetch());\n\nfunction initialiseRepo(git) {\n   return git.init().then(() => git.addRemote('origin', 'https://some.git.repo'));\n}\n```\n\n### Update repo and get a list of tags\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit(__dirname + '/some-repo')\n   .pull()\n   .tags((err, tags) => console.log('Latest available tag: %s', tags.latest));\n\n// update repo and when there are changes, restart the app\nsimpleGit().pull((err, update) => {\n   if (update && update.summary.changes) {\n      require('child_process').exec('npm restart');\n   }\n});\n```\n\n### Starting a new repo\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit()\n   .init()\n   .add('./*')\n   .commit('first commit!')\n   .addRemote('origin', 'https://github.com/user/repo.git')\n   .push('origin', 'master');\n```\n\n### push with `-u`\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit()\n   .add('./*')\n   .commit('first commit!')\n   .addRemote('origin', 'some-repo-url')\n   .push(['-u', 'origin', 'master'], () => console.log('done'));\n```\n\n### Piping to the console for long-running tasks\n\nSee [progress events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md) for more details on\nlogging progress updates.\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit({\n   progress({ method, stage, progress }) {\n      console.log(`git.${method} ${stage} stage ${progress}% complete`);\n   },\n});\ngit.checkout('https://github.com/user/repo.git');\n```\n\n### Update repo and print messages when there are changes, restart the app\n\n```javascript\n// when using a chain\nsimpleGit()\n   .exec(() => console.log('Starting pull...'))\n   .pull((err, update) => {\n      if (update && update.summary.changes) {\n         require('child_process').exec('npm restart');\n      }\n   })\n   .exec(() => console.log('pull done.'));\n\n// when using async and optional chaining\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconsole.log('Starting pull...');\nif ((await git.pull())?.summary.changes) {\n   require('child_process').exec('npm restart');\n}\nconsole.log('pull done.');\n```\n\n### Get a full commits list, and then only between 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 tags\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(await simpleGit().log());\nconsole.log(await simpleGit().log('0.11.0', '0.12.0'));\n```\n\n### Set the local configuration for author, then author for an individual commit\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit()\n   .addConfig('user.name', 'Some One')\n   .addConfig('user.email', 'some@one.com')\n   .commit('committed as \"Some One\"', 'file-one')\n   .commit('committed as \"Another Person\"', 'file-two', {\n      '--author': '\"Another Person <another@person.com>\"',\n   });\n```\n\n### Get remote repositories\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit().listRemote(['--get-url'], (err, data) => {\n   if (!err) {\n      console.log('Remote url for repository at ' + __dirname + ':');\n      console.log(data);\n   }\n});\n```"},"sirv":{"licenses":"MIT","copyright":"","licenseText":"# sirv ![CI](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n\n> The optimized and lightweight middleware for serving requests to static assets\n\nYou may use `sirv` as a *very* fast and lightweight alternative to [`serve-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static).\n\nThe massive performance advantage over `serve-static` is explained by **not** relying on the file system for existence checks on every request. These are expensive interactions and must be avoided whenever possible! Instead, when not in \"dev\" mode, `sirv` performs all its file-system operations upfront and then relies on its cache for future operations.\n\nThis middleware will work out of the box for [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), Express, and other Express-like frameworks. It will also work with the native `http`, `https` and `http2` modules. It requires _very_ little effort to modify/wrap it for servers that don't accept the `(req, res, next)` signature.\n\n:bulb: For a feature-complete CLI application, check out the sibling [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) package as an alternative to [`zeit/serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve)~!\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save sirv\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst sirv = require('sirv');\nconst polka = require('polka');\nconst compress = require('compression')();\n\n// Init `sirv` handler\nconst assets = sirv('public', {\n  maxAge: 31536000, // 1Y\n  immutable: true\n});\n\npolka()\n  .use(compress, assets)\n  .use('/api', require('./api'))\n  .listen(3000, err => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('> Ready on localhost:3000~!');\n  });\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### sirv(dir, opts={})\n\nReturns: `Function`\n\nThe returned function is a middleware in the standard Express-like signature: `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), `res` is the [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), and `next` (in this case) is the function to call if no file was found for the given path.\n\nWhen defined, a `next()` callback is always called _instead of_ the [`opts.onNoMatch`](#optsonnomatch) callback. However, unlike `onNoMatch`, your `next()` is given no arguments.\n\n#### dir\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `.`\n\nThe directory from which to read and serve assets. It is resolved to an absolute path &mdash; you must provide an absolute path yourself if `process.cwd()` is not the correct assumption.\n\n#### opts.dev\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nEnable \"dev\" mode, which disables/skips caching. Instead, `sirv` will traverse the file system ***on every request***.\n\nAdditionally, `dev` mode will ignore `maxAge` and `immutable` as these options generate a production-oriented `Cache-Control` header value.\n\n> **Important:** Do not use `dev` mode in production!\n\n#### opts.etag\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nGenerate and attach an `ETag` header to responses.\n\n> **Note:** If an incoming request's [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) matches the `ETag` value, a `304` response is given.\n\n#### opts.dotfiles\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nAllow requests to dotfiles (files or directories beginning with a `.`).\n\n> **Note:** Requests to [`/.well-known/*`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) are always allowed.\n\n#### opts.extensions\nType: `Array<String>`<br>\nDefault: `['html', 'htm']`\n\nThe file extension fallbacks to check for if a pathame is not initially found. For example, if a `/login` request cannot find a `login` filename, it will then look for `login.html` and `login.htm` before giving up~!\n\n> **Important:** Actually, `sirv` will **also** look for `login/index.html` and `login/index.htm` before giving up.\n\n#### opts.gzip\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nDetermine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.gz` files.<br>\nMust be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include \"gzip\" in order for `sirv` to search for the gzip'd alternative.\n\n> **Note:** The `.gz` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.\n\n```js\n// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE\n// Showing lookup logic\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] \"/foobar.jpg\"\nlookup([\n  '/foobar.jpg.gz', '/foobar.jpg',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.gz',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.gz',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',\n]);\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] \"/\"\nlookup([\n  '/index.html.gz',\n  '/index.htm.gz',\n  '/index.html',\n  '/index.htm',\n]);\n```\n\n\n#### opts.brotli\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nDetermine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.br` files.<br>\nMust be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include either \"br\" or \"brotli\" in order for `sirv` to search for the brotli-compressed alternative.\n\n> **Note:** The `.br` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.\n\nWhen both `opts.broli` and `opts.gzip` are enabled &mdash; and all conditions are equal &mdash; then the brotli variant always takes priority.\n\n```js\n// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE\n// Showing lookup logic\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br] \"/foobar.jpg\"\nlookup([\n  '/foobar.jpg.br', '/foobar.jpg',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.br',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.br',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',\n]);\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br,gz] \"/\"\nlookup([\n  '/index.html.br'\n  '/index.htm.br'\n  '/index.html.gz'\n  '/index.htm.gz'\n  '/index.html'\n  '/index.htm'\n]);\n```\n\n#### opts.maxAge\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nEnables the `Cache-Control` header on responses and sets the `max-age` value (in seconds).<br>\nFor example, `maxAge: 31536000` is equivalent to one year.\n\n#### opts.immutable\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nAppends the [`immutable` directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Revalidation_and_reloading) on your `Cache-Control` header, used for uniquely-named assets that will not change!\n\n> **Important:** Will only work if `opts.maxAge` has a value defined!\n\n#### opts.single\nType: `Boolean` or `String`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nTreat the directory as a single-page application.\n\nWhen `true`, the directory's index page (default `index.html`) will be sent if the request asset does not exist.<br>\nYou may pass a `string` value to use a file _instead of_ `index.html` as your fallback.\n\nFor example, if \"/about\" is requested but no variants of that file exist, then the response for \"/\" is sent instead:\n\n```js\n// Note: This is psuedo code to illustrate what's happening\n\n// Request: \"/about\"\nlet file = find(['/about', '/about.html', '/about.htm', '/about/index.html', '/about.htm']);\nif (file) {\n  send(file);\n} else if (opts.single === true) {\n  file = find(['/', '/index.html', '/index.htm']);\n  send(file);\n} else if (typeof opts.single === 'string') {\n  file = find([opts.single]);\n  send(file);\n} else {\n  // next() or 404\n}\n```\n\n#### opts.ignores\nType: `false` or `Array<String | RegExp>`\n\nSpecify paths/patterns that should ignore the fallback behavior that `opts.single` provides.\n\nBy default, any asset-like path (URLs that end with an extension) will be ignored. This means that, for example, if `/foobar.jpg` is not found, a `404` response is sent instead of the `index.html` fallback.\n\nAdditionally, any `/.well-known/*` pathname ignores the fallback – as do all other dotfile requests when `opts.dotfiles` is enabled.\n\nAny string value(s) will be passed through `new RegExp(value, 'i')` directly.\n\nFinally, you may set `ignores: false` to disable ***all*** ignores, including the defaults. Put differently, this will fallback ***all*** unknown pathnames to your `index.html` (or custom `opts.single` value).\n\n> **Important:** Only has an effect if `opts.single` is enabled.\n\n#### opts.onNoMatch\nType: `Function`\n\nA custom function to run if a file cannot be found for a given request. <br>By default, `sirv` will send a basic `(404) Not found` response.\n\nThe function receives the current `req <IncomingMessage>, res <ServerResponse>` pair for as its two arguments.\n\n> **Note:** This won't run if a `next` callback has been provided to the middleware; see [`sirv`](#sirvdir-opts) description.\n\n#### opts.setHeaders\nType: `Function`\n\nA custom function to append or change any headers on the outgoing response. There is no default.\n\nIts signature is `(res, pathname, stats)`, where `res` is the `ServerResponse`, `pathname` is incoming request path (stripped of queries), and `stats` is the file's result from [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path).\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Luke Edwards](https://lukeed.com)"},"sisteransi":{"licenses":"MIT","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2018 Terkel Gjervig Nielsen","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018 Terkel Gjervig Nielsen\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
